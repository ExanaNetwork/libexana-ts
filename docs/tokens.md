# Groups and Tokens

Groups are core concepts in the Nexa ecosystem, allowing for the creation, management, and transfer of custom assets (Tokens / NFTs). Using the `GroupToken` class, you can perform a variety of operations, including:

- Creating new token groups.
- Minting/Melting and managing tokens authorities.
- Querying token properties and metadata.

For a technical overview and detailed breakdown of all the options, refer to the official [Nexa Group Tokenization](https://spec.nexa.org/tokens/grouptokens/) docs.

The `GroupToken` class provides robust functionality for working with these assets.
For a complete breakdown of available methods and examples, see API Reference below.
